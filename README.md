I designed this to be my standard React app template.

This contains an example of two components.

First, a REST API that contacts the backend Node.js server and displays a message
from that endpoint when the button is clicked.

Second, a webhook that posts a file uploaded by the user to an AWS S3 bucket when
the user clicks the upload button.
